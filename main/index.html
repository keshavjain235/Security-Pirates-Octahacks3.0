                <div class="description">Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It's also your brain's main source of fuel.
The underlying cause of diabetes varies by type. But, no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in your blood. Too much sugar in your blood can lead to serious health problems.
Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes occurs when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. And prediabetes is often the precursor of diabetes unless appropriate measures are taken to prevent progression. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy but may resolve after the baby is delivered.
<h2>Symptoms</h2><p>Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.</p>
<p>Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increased thirst</li>
    <li>Frequent urination</li>
    <li>Extreme hunger</li>
    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
    <li>Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin)</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Irritability</li>
    <li>Blurred vision</li>
    <li>Slow-healing sores</li>
    <li>Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections</li>
</ul>
<p>Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.</p>

                <div class="description">The liver is an organ about the size of a football. It sits just under your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen. The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances.
Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). Liver problems can also be caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses, alcohol use and obesity.
Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring (cirrhosis), which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition. But early treatment may give the liver time to heal.</div>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
			<p>Liver disease doesn't always cause noticeable signs and symptoms. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do occur, the may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice)</li>
    <li>Abdominal pain and swelling</li>
    <li>Swelling in the legs and ankles</li>
    <li>Itchy skin</li>
    <li>Dark urine color</li>

    <li>Loss of appetite</li>

                <div class="description">Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.
The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.
Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices

                <div class="description">Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.
After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.
Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
<li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast</li>
<li>Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling</li>
<li>A newly inverted nipple</li>
<li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin</li>
<li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
